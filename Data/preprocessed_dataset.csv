astronomy,astronomy literally meaning the science that studies the laws of the stars is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena it uses mathematics physics and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution objects of interest include planets moons stars nebulae galaxies and comments relevant phenomena include supernova explosions gamma ray bursts quays ours blazers pulsars and cosmic microwave background radiation more generally astronomy studies everything that originates beyond earth's atmosphere cosmology as a branch of astronomy that studies the universe as a whole during the renaissance nicolaus copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system his work was defended by galileo galilei and expanded upon by johannes kepler kepler was the first to devise a system that correctly described the details of the motion of the plan minutes surround the sun however kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down one of the oldest fields in astronomy and in all of science is the measurement of the positions of celestial objects historically accurate knowledge of the positions of the sun moon planets and stars has been essential in celestial navigation the use of celestial objects to guide navigation and in the making of calendars theorists and astronomy endeavored to create theoretical models and from the results predict observational consequences of those models the observation of a phenomenon predicted by model allows astronomers to see select between several alternate or conflicting models as the one best able to describe the phenomenon what is the origin of the stellar mass spectrum that is why do astronomers observe the same distribution of stellar masses the initial mass function apparently regardless of the initial conditions a deeper understanding of the formation of stars and planets is needed amateur astronomers continue to make scientific contributions to the field of astronomy and it is one of the few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions,astronomy literally mean science study law star natural science study celestial object phenomena use mathematic physics chemistry order explain origin evolution object interest include planet moon stars nebula galaxie comment relevant phenomenon include supernova explosion gamma ray burst quay blazer pillars cosmic microwave background radiation generally astronomy study everything originate beyond earth atmosphere cosmology branch astronomy studies universe whole renaissance nicolas copernicus propose heliocentric model solar system work defend galileo galileo expand upon johannes helper helper first devise system correctly describe detail motion plan minute surround sun however helper not succeed formulate theory behind law write one old field astronomy science measurement position celestial object historically accurate knowledge position sun moon planet star essential celestial navigation use celestial object guide navigation make calendars theorist astronomy endeavor create theoretical model result predict observational consequence model observation phenomenon predict model allow astronomer see select several alternate conflict model one good able describe phenomenon origin stellar mass spectrum astronomer observe distribution stellar mass initial mass function apparently regardless initial condition deep understanding formation star planet need amateur astronomer continue make scientific contribution field astronomy one scientific discipline amateur still make significant contribution
white dwarf,a white dwarf also called a degenerate dwarf is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron degenerate matter a white dwarf is very dense it's mass is comparable to that of the sun while it's volume is comparable to that of earth a white dwarfs faint luminosity comes from the emission of residual third mold energy no fusion takes place in a white dwarf the nearest known white dwarf is sirius be at eight point six light years the smaller component of the serious binary star there are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the sun the unusual faintness of white dwarves was first recognized in nineteen ten the name white dwarf was coined by william law eitan and nineteen twenty two white dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star or a black hole this includes over ninety seven percent of the other stars and the milky way usually white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen seal white dwarf if the mass of the progenitor is between eight and ten point five solar masses and kama the core temperature will be sufficient to fuse carbon but not neon in which case and knox edge and neon magnesium white dwarf may form stars are very low mass will be unable to fuse helium hence a helium white dwarf the material in a white dwarf no longer undergoes fusion reactions so the star has no source of energy as a result it cannot support itself by the heat generated by fusion against gravitational collapse apps but is supported only by electron degeneracy pressure causing it to be extremely dance the physics of degeneracy yields a maximum mass for a non-rotating white dwarf the chondrus sacre limit approximately one point four four times them beyond which it cannot be supported by electron degeneracy pressure a white dwarf is very hot when it forms but because it has no source of energy it will gradually cool as it radiates it's energy away this means that it's radiation which initially has a high color temperature will last and and reddened with time over a very long time a white dwarf will cool and it's material will begin to crystallize as starting with the core the star's low temperature means it will no longer amid significant heat or light and it will become a cold black dwarf ,white dwarf also call degenerate dwarf stellar core remnant compose mostly electron degenerate matter white dwarf dense mass comparable sun volume comparable earth white dwarf faint luminosity come emission residual third mold energy fusion take place white dwarf nearest know white dwarf siris eight point six light year small component serious binary star currently think eight white dwarf among hundred star system near sun unusual fitness white dwarf first recognize nineteen ten name white dwarf coin william law titan nineteen twenty two white dwarf think final evolutionary state star whose mass not high enough become neutron star black hole include ninety seven percent star milky way usually white dwarf compose carbon oxygen seal white dwarf mass progenitor eight ten point five solar masse sama core temperature sufficient fuse carbon not neon case knox edge neon magnesium white dwarf may form star low mass unable fuse helium hence helium white dwarf material white dwarf long undergo fusion reaction star source energy result can not support heat generate fusion gravitational collapse app support electron degenerate pressure cause extremely dance physics degenerate yield maximum mass non rotate white dwarf chorus acre limit approximately one point four four time beyond can not supported electron degenerate pressure white dwarf hot form source energy gradually cool radiate energy away mean radiation initially high color temperature last render time long time white dwarf cool material begin crystalline start core star low temperature mean longer amid significant heat light become cold black dwarf
