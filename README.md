# TigerGraph's Video-Recommendation-System
This is a Graph database-based tool to get your favourite videos recommended based on provided keywords along with the ability to pinpoint where the keyword was spoken in the videos! The dataset incorporates a variety of themes like finance, cryptocurrency, animals, astronomy, literature, authors etc. 

The topics analytics page will allow you to find an interactive topic model generated on the dataset that coordinates the similarity between different topics and the videos they belong to using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. 

Head over to our explore visuals section to dive deep into the dataset by looking at various entities and a dynamic cytoscape to visualise the network of keywords we are working with. You can observe how various keywords appear in different videos and the vast graph that connects them!
